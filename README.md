# Comparison of search algorithms
There is a comparison of 5 substring search algorithms:
1. BruteForce
2. Apostolico-Crochemore
3. KnuthMorrisPratt
4. Z-function
5. DeterministicFiniteAutomaton
### Benchmark
Also, this project has a benchmark. To start it you need to launch benchmark.py  
and write in console how many times you want to test algorithms (more times = more detailed statistics).  
After this benchmark will create .png files with statistics.
